## Usage
Creating an employee directory using React. A table displays the employees non-sensitive data with a picture of the employee, their full name, email, office number, and cell phone number.  A search bar at the top of the page under the header lets a user sort the employees by name and a button on the name column of the employee table lets you sort the employees by name in accending order alphabetically. When sorted a down arrows appears next to name so the user will be able to tell easily if the list was sorted. The user can also sort the employees by name alphabetically when using the search bar.

## Setup
This application was created in react with componets. UseState is used to more easily manage state and useEffect is used to respond to user events more effectivly. The app is broken up into three componenets: employee, table, and searchbar. The individual components hold props. UseEffect is helpful in setting up the sorting and filtering capabilites of the table.

The employee table is limited to the first 100 people that came out the Random User API. This was done so the app will load quicker and not change everytime the page is refreshed to mimic what a real employee directory is like since your employees likely don't change every day. 

## What I Learned
This project was difficult to set up at first. I was trying to figure out how the components would talk together and come together in App.js. I ultimaly decided to use hooks as it was easier to manage and change the state of the components with useState. UseEffect also took some tweaking and reading, but it helped a lot with how to sort the employees. I chose to sort the employees by name as it was the easiest attriubute to pick out of the returned array.  

Getting the app the deploy also took some tweaking as github wasn't getting the right url to the app from 'homepage'. I just had to go correct it in the packagelock.json and then push that for the web app to deploy correctly.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
